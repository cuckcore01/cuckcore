	<p>The Fella Is A Bitch The Fella Is A Cuck<br>
	it didn't matter as much as the artistic references and the aesthetic style, crack art, ultra realist, hyper tone advancement clashes in the sky with alcoholic folkart tranquility. The realm of art is an opaque mystery. Questions had to be settled, wars fought, history made. Teams were forming across the globe, nations, regiments, squadrons, the russians already had some cool profile pics, clearly they had some strategy in their budget for memetic design, fucked up looking jacked dudes, track pants, vodka bottles, soviet housing core, slavic glitch textures on the shading. All things follow by a natural course, art, though appearing to be free, is confined to the disc, encoded in file systems and applications, but in that structure, much could happened, especially when two art discs are placed in competition with each other on a single computer, and that computer placed in competition with other computers, and those computers against other groups of computers, and so on, the web continuously expanding through the information channels, inevitably culturally interesting scenarios will erupt, and many dead bodies of artists over drained and suffering will pile up before they find their salvation in the clashing of electrons in the beautiful sky above, so said the wizard npc before Jofella got bored and crashed his system by trying to insert his balls into the cd tray.</p>
